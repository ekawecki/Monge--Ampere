# Monge--Ampere

The Python script given in this repository is up to date with the current latest FeNiCs install (1.6), which can be downloaded 
at https://fenicsproject.org/.

FeNiCs is used for the automated solution of Partial Differential Equations. 

The script we provide approximates solutions to the Monge--Ampere 
optimal mass transport problem, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03535.

If you use this code please reference the authors: Ellya Kawecki, Omar Lakkis, and Tristan Pryer, https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03535.

The zip folder contains different meshes that the Python script calls.
